# Weather Features Documentation

## Overview
CloudDeck provides comprehensive aviation weather information through various features and data visualizations.

## Weather Map

### Map Overview
The Weather Map is a central feature of CloudDeck that provides a visual representation of current aviation weather conditions across airports. The map displays meteorological conditions using color-coded markers that indicate flight categories (VFR, MVFR, IFR, LIFR) for each reporting station.

### Technical Implementation
- **Component**: `WeatherMap.jsx`
- **Library**: Uses React-Leaflet for map rendering
- **Base Map**: OpenStreetMap tiles
- **Data Source**: Aviation weather API providing METAR data
- **Refresh Rate**: Updates every 5 minutes when active

### Flight Categories
The map uses a standardized color-coding system to represent different flight categories:
- **VFR (Visual Flight Rules)**: Green (#3CB371) - Ceiling greater than 3,000 feet AGL and visibility greater than 5 miles
- **MVFR (Marginal VFR)**: Blue (#4169E1) - Ceiling 1,000-3,000 feet AGL and/or visibility 3-5 miles
- **IFR (Instrument Flight Rules)**: Red (#FF4500) - Ceiling 500-999 feet AGL and/or visibility 1-3 miles
- **LIFR (Low IFR)**: Pink (#FF69B4) - Ceiling below 500 feet AGL and/or visibility less than 1 mile
- **Unknown**: Gray (#808080) - Data unavailable or insufficient

### Features
- **Interactive Markers**: Each airport is represented by a color-coded marker
- **Detailed Popups**: Click on any marker to view detailed weather information including:
  - Temperature
  - Wind direction and speed
  - Visibility
  - Cloud layers
  - Flight category
- **Auto-refresh**: Weather data automatically updates while the map is active
- **Responsive Design**: Map adapts to different screen sizes
- **Performance Optimization**: Only loads data when the map component is active

### Usage
1. Navigate to the Weather Map tab in the application
2. The map will center on the United States by default
3. Zoom and pan to explore different regions
4. Click on any colored dot to view detailed weather for that airport
5. The legend at the top shows the meaning of each color
6. Last update time is displayed to show data freshness

### Data Processing
The map processes raw METAR data through several steps:
1. Fetches data from the aviation weather API
2. Parses and formats the raw data for display
3. Assigns appropriate flight categories based on ceiling and visibility
4. Creates custom markers with appropriate colors
5. Renders the data on the map with interactive popups

### Future Enhancements
Planned improvements for the Weather Map include:
1. Multiple map layer options (satellite, terrain, aviation sectionals)
2. Weather radar overlay showing precipitation
3. Wind barbs on markers to show wind direction and speed
4. Route planning capabilities
5. Time-based playback of weather changes
6. Mobile-optimized controls
7. Offline mode with cached data
